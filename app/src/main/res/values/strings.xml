    <string name="wine_detail_text_sample"><![CDATA[Fortified wine from the Jerez de la Frontera
    district in southern Spain. Palomino is the main grape variety, with Pedro Ximénez used for the sweeter, heavier wines.
    Drier Sherries are best served chilled; the medium-sweet to sweet are best at room temperature.
    Ranging from dry to very sweet, the styles are: Manzanilla, Fino, Amontillado, Oloroso, Pale Cream,
    Cream, Palo, and Pedro Ximénez. Shiraz/Syrah Black cherry, spice, pepper, tar & leather with smooth
    tannins & supple texture make this wine a growing favorite. With early drinking appeal it also has the
    ability to age well to form more complex wines.]]></string>
